# 🫀 Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

This project is part of my **AI/ML Engineering Internship** at **DevelopersHub Corporation**. It aims to build a predictive model to assess the risk of heart disease using clinical data. This task emphasizes medical data understanding, classification modeling, and model evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on health attributes using a classification algorithm.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
- **Records:** 303 entries
- **Features:**
  - Age, gender, chest pain type (`cp`)
  - Resting blood pressure (`trestbps`), cholesterol, fasting blood sugar
  - Resting ECG (`restecg`), max heart rate (`thalach`), exercise-induced angina
  - ST depression, slope, number of major vessels, thalassemia
- **Target:** `target` — 1 (disease), 0 (no disease)

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

- Checked for missing/null values (none found)
- Converted categorical variables (e.g., `cp`, `slope`, `thal`) to numerical format
- Applied `StandardScaler` for feature scaling
- Split data into **train** and **test** sets (80/20)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution plots for numeric features
- Correlation heatmap
- Count plots for categorical variables
- Feature-target relationships visualized using Seaborn & Matplotlib

---

## 🤖 Model Building

- **Algorithm:** `Logistic Regression`
  - Lightweight and interpretable classifier
- Model trained using `scikit-learn`
- Saved model using `joblib` as:  
  - `heart_disease_model.pkl`  
  - `scaler.pkl` (for consistent input scaling)

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics

| Metric            | Result         |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Accuracy          | ~85%           |
| ROC AUC Score     | ~0.90          |
| Confusion Matrix  | ✔️ Visualized  |
| ROC Curve         | ✔️ Visualized  |

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Chest pain type**, **thalassemia**, and **max heart rate** were strong indicators.
- The model successfully generalizes across unseen data with good ROC-AUC performance.
- Logistic Regression is suitable for binary classification in healthcare diagnostics.
